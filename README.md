# Movie-IMDB-Database-Search
The following assignment shows the use of jQuery Mobile, JavaScript and AJAX. We had to sign up to get our own API key in the 
IMDB database. This assignment provided a significant amount of challenges, but overall I prooud with the end result. 

Some challenges included
  - Getting the Movie poster to display a white imag if it wasn't available
  - Not having the movie append each other everytime a user type a something in the filter box field. To resolve this I had to 
    implement the .empty() jQuery function at the end of the search results.
  - I also had to remove the "ui-screen-hidden" class because the event filterablebeforefilter would automatically
    hide some child elements and autmatically add the class ui-screen-hidden therefore not displaying all results.
