# Movie-IMDB-Database-Search
The following assignment shows the use of jQuery Mobile, JavaScript and AJAX. We had to create our own API key in the 
IMDB database. This assignment provided a significant amount of challenges, but overall I prooud with the end result. 

Some challenges included
  - Getting the Movie poster to display a white imag if it wasn't available
  - Not having the movie append each other everytime a user type a something in the filter box field. To resolve this I had to 
    implement the .empty() jQuery function at the end of the search results.
  - I also had to remove the "ui-screen-hidden" class because the event filterablebeforefilter would automatically
    hide some child elements and autmatically add the class ui-screen-hidden therefore not displaying all results.
